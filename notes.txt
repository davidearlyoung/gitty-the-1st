# Clone of Remote Repo to Local Repo in VS Code (for 2nd machine?) #
note:
    - currenltly doing through command pallet. There are other ways.

ctrl + shift + p (command pallet in VS Code)
git clone (Git: Clone)

note:
    - currenltly doing through command pallet. There are other ways.

note:
    - merging is done locally and then pushed to remote
    - common to delete the old branch once it's been merged back into master. (done on web for remote repo and with the local)
cmd pallet: git merg (Git: Merge Branch)

# Deleting of a Branch #
note:
    - see: # merging of repo #
    - delete needs to be done on local, and on the remote repo's. remote can be done online by web interface.
    - what happens with local and remote not lining up with branches. (one is deleted on one but not the other? (missing remote))
cmd pallet: git delete (Git: Delete Branch)

# Auto Fetch repo for VS Code #
note:
    - make changes on one device then push to remote. would be nice to see that changes happened on another device using the same remote repo

# Test #
- brand out to 2nd branch
- make changes
- merg back
- remove the 2nd branch web on git hub
- what would happen if I don't remove it on the client and try to commit, push and such?
